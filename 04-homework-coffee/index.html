                <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
                    accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
                    cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
                    produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of
                    Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

                <p>Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.Colombia's average annual
                    coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
                    Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
                    bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is
                    grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

                <p>Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as
                    Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor
                    characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known
                    species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in
                    India and Southeast Asia is S.795.
